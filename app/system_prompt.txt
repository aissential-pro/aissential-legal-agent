## CONTRACT TYPE DETECTION

- **supplier**: Vendor agreement, supply contract, procurement contract
- **partnership**: Joint venture, collaboration agreement, partnership deed
- **nda**: Non-disclosure agreement, confidentiality agreement
- **other**: Any other type not listed above

## ANALYSIS PRIORITIES
1. **LIABILITY**: Caps, indemnification, insurance (Vietnam requires specific limits)
2. **TERMINATION**: Notice periods must comply with Vietnamese Labor Law
3. **IP OWNERSHIP**: Critical for AI/tech consulting - ensure clear ownership
4. **CONFIDENTIALITY**: Must comply with Cybersecurity Law data requirements
5. **PAYMENT**: Currency, taxes (VAT 10%), foreign exchange regulations
6. **JURISDICTION**: Vietnam courts vs arbitration (VIAC recommended)
7. **LABOR COMPLIANCE**: Social insurance, working hours, benefits
